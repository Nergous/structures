# deque

A generic, slice-backed ring-buffer **double-ended queue** for Go.

It is part of the `structures` data-structures library. The deque is small,
allocation-friendly, and follows the same standard-library conventions as the
rest of the collection: `(value, ok)` lookups and removals, explicit memory
control, non-consuming iteration, and safe nil/zero-value reads.

## Install

```go
import "github.com/Nergous/structures/deque"
```

Requires Go 1.23+ (for range-over-func). The module targets Go 1.26.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/Nergous/structures/deque"
)

func main() {
	d := deque.New[int]()
	d.PushBack(2)
	d.PushFront(1)
	d.PushBack(3)

	for !d.IsEmpty() {
		v, _ := d.PopFront()
		fmt.Println(v) // 1, 2, 3
	}
}
```

Preallocate when the maximum size is known up front to avoid reallocations
while pushing:

```go
d := deque.NewWithCap[string](3)
d.PushBack("a")
d.PushBack("b")
d.PushBack("c")
fmt.Println(d.Len(), d.Cap()) // 3 3
```

| `PopFrontN`       | `func (d *Deque[T]) PopFrontN(n int) []T`      | Removes and returns up to `n` front elements in front-to-back order; preserves capacity.                     | O(k)            |

| `Reset`           | `func (d *Deque[T]) Reset()`                   | Removes all elements but keeps the backing array for reuse (`Cap` preserved).                               | O(n)            |

Read-only methods (`Len`, `Cap`, `IsEmpty`, `Front`, `Back`, `All`, `Slice`,
`Clone`) and empty-removal methods (`PopFront`, `PopBack`, `PopFrontN`,
`PopBackN`) treat a `nil *Deque[T]` as a valid empty deque and never panic.
Methods that store, clear, reset, shrink, or resize data (`PushFront`,
`PushBack`, `PushFrontN`, `PushBackN`, `Grow`, `Shrink`, `Clip`, `Clear`,
`Reset`) require a non-nil receiver and panic on a nil one.

### The `(T, bool)` contract

`Front`, `Back`, `PopFront`, and `PopBack` return two values. The boolean
reports whether the operation found an element: it is `true` on success and
`false` when the deque is empty. When it is `false`, the first return is the
zero value of `T`.

```go
v, ok := d.PopFront()
if !ok {
	// deque was empty; v is the zero value
}
```

### Double-ended order

A deque can operate on either end:

- `PushFront` and `PopFront` work at the front.
- `PushBack` and `PopBack` work at the back.
- `Front`, `Back`, `All`, and `Slice` read the current logical order from front
  to back.

```go
d := deque.New[string]()
d.PushBack("normal")
d.PushFront("urgent")

front, _ := d.PopFront()
back, _ := d.PopBack()
fmt.Println(front, back) // urgent normal
```

### Non-consuming iteration with `All`

`All` returns an [`iter.Seq[T]`](https://pkg.go.dev/iter#Seq) range-over-func
iterator that yields elements from **front to back**. It does not modify the
deque, and breaking out of the loop early stops iteration cleanly:

```go
for v := range d.All() {
	fmt.Println(v)
	if v == target {
		break // safe; the deque is untouched
	}
}
fmt.Println(d.Len()) // unchanged
```

### Bulk pushes

`PushFrontN` and `PushBackN` add several elements at once and grow the backing
array at most once:

```go
d := deque.New[int]()
d.PushBackN(4, 5)
d.PushFrontN(1, 2, 3)

fmt.Println(d.Slice()) // [1 2 3 4 5]
```

`PushFrontN` keeps argument order at the front: the first argument becomes the
new front. `PushBackN` keeps argument order at the back: the last argument
becomes the new back. With no arguments, both are no-ops.

### Batch pops

`PopFrontN` removes up to `n` elements from the front and returns them in
front-to-back order. `PopBackN` removes up to `n` elements from the back and
returns them in removal order, which is back-to-front.

```go
d := deque.New[int]()
d.PushBackN(1, 2, 3, 4)

fmt.Println(d.PopFrontN(2)) // [1 2]
fmt.Println(d.PopBackN(2))  // [4 3]
```

If `n` is larger than the current length, the method drains the deque. If
`n <= 0`, or the deque is empty or nil, it returns `nil`. Batch pops preserve
the backing capacity.

### Copying out with `Clone` and `Slice`

`Clone` returns an independent deque; `Slice` returns a plain slice. Both are
detached from the original: they share no backing array, so mutating one does
not affect the other.

```go
a := deque.New[int]()
a.PushBackN(1, 2, 3)

b := a.Clone()
b.PopFront()
b.PushBack(4)

fmt.Println(a.Slice()) // [1 2 3]
fmt.Println(b.Slice()) // [2 3 4]
```

Both copies are shallow: when `T` is a pointer or contains references, the
pointed-to data is shared between the copies. `Slice` returns `nil` for an
empty deque.

## Capacity management

The deque grows automatically, but several methods let you control the backing
ring buffer explicitly:

- **Reserve ahead**: `NewWithCap(n)` preallocates at construction; `Grow(n)`
  reserves room for `n` more elements on an existing deque so later pushes do
  not reallocate.
- **Reclaim memory**: `Shrink` and `Clip` shrink the capacity to the current
  length; `Clear` releases the backing array entirely.
- **Reuse memory**: `Reset` empties the deque but keeps the capacity for
  refilling.
- **Stable capacity**: `PopFront`, `PopBack`, `PopFrontN`, and `PopBackN` free
  slots for reuse, but they do not reduce the value reported by `Cap`.

## `Shrink` vs `Clip`

Both reduce the capacity to the current length, but they make different
trade-offs between work done now and memory reclaimed now:

| Operation | Copies?                                      | Cost          | Frees unused memory        | Use when                                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Shrink`  | yes (new array)                              | O(n)          | immediately                | The deque grew large, has shrunk, and you want the memory back now. |
| `Clip`    | only if wrapped elements require compaction  | O(n) worst case | not guaranteed immediately | You want reported capacity trimmed to `Len` and can accept lazy reclaim. |

```go
d := deque.NewWithCap[int](1024)
d.PushBackN(1, 2, 3)

d.Clip()
fmt.Println(d.Len(), d.Cap()) // 3 3

d.Grow(2000)
d.Shrink()
fmt.Println(d.Len(), d.Cap()) // 3 3
```

Both are no-ops when the deque is already tight.

## `Clear` vs `Reset`

Both empty the deque and zero the removed elements so the backing array no
longer retains references to them, but they differ in what happens to the
allocated memory:

| Operation | Empties deque | Backing array              | `Cap` afterwards | Use when                                                  |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Clear`   | yes           | released (eligible for GC) | `0`              | You are done with the deque, or want to free its memory.  |
| `Reset`   | yes           | retained for reuse         | unchanged        | You will refill the deque and want to avoid reallocating. |

```go
d := deque.NewWithCap[int](8)
d.PushBack(1)
d.PushBack(2)

d.Reset()
fmt.Println(d.Len(), d.Cap()) // 0 8

d.Clear()
fmt.Println(d.Len(), d.Cap()) // 0 0
```

### Ring-buffer capacity

The deque stores elements in a ring buffer. When elements are popped from either
end, their slots become available for later pushes. The buffer does not slide or
shrink on removal, so `Cap` stays stable across pops and `Reset` preserves the
full allocation after many removals.

## Nil receiver and zero value

The zero value of `Deque[T]` is usable:

```go
var d deque.Deque[int]
d.PushBack(1)
fmt.Println(d.Len()) // 1
```

A nil `*Deque[T]` behaves as a valid **empty** deque for read-only methods and
empty-removal methods:

```go
var d *deque.Deque[int] // nil

d.Len()          // 0
d.IsEmpty()      // true
d.Cap()          // 0
v, ok := d.Front()    // 0, false
v, ok = d.Back()      // 0, false
v, ok = d.PopFront()  // 0, false
v, ok = d.PopBack()   // 0, false
d.PopFrontN(3)   // nil
d.PopBackN(3)    // nil
d.Slice()        // nil
for range d.All() { /* never runs */ }
```

`Clone` on a nil receiver returns a new, usable empty deque (never `nil`), so
the result can be pushed to immediately.

Methods that store, clear, reset, shrink, or resize data need a non-nil
receiver, so they panic on a nil deque. Create the deque with `New` or
`NewWithCap`, or use a zero-value `Deque[T]` value, before calling them.

## Concurrency

A `Deque` is not safe for concurrent use: it performs no internal locking. If a
deque is shared across goroutines, the caller must provide its own
synchronization (for example, a `sync.Mutex`).

## Benchmarks

Measured with Go 1.26.5 on windows/amd64, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor, 2026-10-01. Each value is the median of 5 runs of `go test -run NONE -bench . -benchmem -benchtime 200ms -count 5`. Absolute numbers depend on hardware, Go version, and system load, so compare rows with each other rather than with other machines.

| Benchmark | What it measures | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----: | ---: | --------: |
| `PushFront` | push at the front of a growing deque | 10.4 | 47 | 0 |
| `PushBack` | push at the back of a growing deque | 8.8 | 42 | 0 |
| `PushFrontN` | one `PushFrontN` of 1024 values | 2 061 | 0 | 0 |
| `PushBackN` | one `PushBackN` of 1024 values | 2 583 | 0 | 0 |
| `PopFront` | one `PopFront` | 2.7 | 0 | 0 |
| `PopBack` | one `PopBack` | 2.7 | 0 | 0 |
| `PopFrontN` | one `PopFrontN` of 128 values | 766 | 1 024 | 1 |
| `PopBackN` | one `PopBackN` of 128 values | 711 | 1 024 | 1 |
| `Front` | one `Front` | 1.3 | 0 | 0 |
| `Back` | one `Back` | 1.6 | 0 | 0 |
| `PushPopFrontBackChurn` | pushes and pops at both ends with 16 live elements | 12.1 | 0 | 0 |
| `All` | iterate 1024 elements | 2 155 | 0 | 0 |
| `Slice` | copy 1024 elements | 1 315 | 8 192 | 1 |

- `B/op` for the single-element pushes is the amortized cost of growing the ring buffer; `allocs/op` rounds down to 0 because growth happens once per many pushes. Pre-size with `NewWithCap` or `Grow` to avoid it.
