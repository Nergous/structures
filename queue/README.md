# queue

A generic, slice-backed ring-buffer **FIFO** (first-in, first-out) queue for Go.

It is part of the `structures` data-structures library. The queue is small,
allocation-friendly, and follows the same standard-library conventions as the
rest of the collection (the `(value, ok)` contract, explicit memory control,
non-consuming iteration, and a usable nil/zero value for reads).

## Install

```go
import "github.com/Nergous/structures/queue"
```

Requires Go 1.23+. The module targets Go 1.26.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/Nergous/structures/queue"
)

func main() {
	q := queue.New[int]()
	q.Push(1)
	q.Push(2)
	q.Push(3)

	for !q.IsEmpty() {
		v, _ := q.Pop()
		fmt.Println(v) // 1, 2, 3
	}
}
```

Preallocate when the maximum size is known up front to avoid reallocations
while pushing:

```go
q := queue.NewWithCap[string](3)
q.Push("a")
q.Push("b")
q.Push("c")
fmt.Println(q.Len(), q.Cap()) // 3 3
```

| `PopN`            | `func (q *Queue[T]) PopN(n int) []T`       | Removes and returns up to `n` front elements in FIFO order; preserves capacity.                        | O(k)           |

| `Clip`            | `func (q *Queue[T]) Clip()`                | Reduces reported capacity to `Len`; copies only when wrapped elements need compaction.                 | O(n) worst case |
| `Clear`           | `func (q *Queue[T]) Clear()`               | Removes all elements **and releases** the backing array (`Cap` drops to 0).                            | O(1)           |
| `Reset`           | `func (q *Queue[T]) Reset()`               | Removes all elements but **keeps** the backing array for reuse (`Cap` preserved).                      | O(n)           |

Read-only methods (`Len`, `Cap`, `IsEmpty`, `Peek`, `All`, `Slice`, `Clone`)
and empty-removal methods (`Pop`, `PopN`) treat a `nil *Queue[T]` as a valid
empty queue and never panic. Methods that store or resize data (`Push`, `PushN`,
`Grow`, `Shrink`, `Clip`, `Clear`, `Reset`) require a non-nil receiver and panic
on a nil one.

### The `(T, bool)` contract

`Peek` and `Pop` return two values. The boolean reports whether the operation
found an element: it is `true` on success and `false` when the queue is empty.
When it is `false`, the first return is the zero value of `T`.

```go
v, ok := q.Pop()
if !ok {
	// queue was empty; v is the zero value
}
```

### FIFO order

A queue removes elements in the same order they were added: `Push` appends to the
back, `Pop`, `PopN`, and `Peek` operate on the front (the oldest element still
present).

```go
q := queue.New[string]()
q.Push("first")
q.Push("last")

v, _ := q.Pop()
fmt.Println(v) // first
```

### Non-consuming iteration with `All`

`All` returns an [`iter.Seq[T]`](https://pkg.go.dev/iter#Seq) — a Go 1.23
range-over-func iterator — that yields elements from **front to back** (FIFO
order). It does not modify the queue, and breaking out of the loop early stops
iteration cleanly:

```go
for v := range q.All() {
	fmt.Println(v)
	if v == target {
		break // safe; the queue is untouched
	}
}
fmt.Println(q.Len()) // unchanged
```

### Bulk push with `PushN`

`PushN` adds several elements at once **in argument order**, so the last
argument ends up at the back — exactly as if you called `Push` for each in turn,
but it grows the backing array at most once instead of on every element:

```go
q := queue.New[int]()
q.PushN(1, 2, 3) // same as Push(1); Push(2); Push(3)

front, _ := q.Peek()
fmt.Println(front) // 1
```

With no arguments it is a no-op.

### Batch pop with `PopN`

`PopN` removes up to `n` elements from the front and returns them in FIFO order.
If `n` is larger than the current length, it drains the queue. If `n <= 0`, or
the queue is empty or nil, it returns `nil`.

```go
q := queue.New[int]()
q.PushN(1, 2, 3, 4)

batch := q.PopN(3)
fmt.Println(batch) // [1 2 3]
fmt.Println(q.Slice()) // [4]
```

`PopN` preserves the backing capacity, so it works well for batch consumers that
reuse the same queue.

### Copying out with `Clone` and `Slice`

`Clone` returns an independent queue; `Slice` returns a plain slice. Both are
detached from the original — they share no backing array, so mutating one does
not affect the other:

```go
a := queue.New[int]()
a.PushN(1, 2, 3)

b := a.Clone() // independent *Queue[int]
b.Pop()        // does not touch a
fmt.Println(a.Len(), b.Len()) // 3 2

out := a.Slice() // []int{1, 2, 3} — front to back, like All
fmt.Println(out)
```

Both copies are **shallow**: when `T` is a pointer or contains references, the
pointed-to data is shared between the copies. `Slice` returns `nil` for an
empty queue.

## Capacity management

The queue grows automatically, but several methods let you control the backing
ring buffer explicitly:

- **Reserve ahead** — `NewWithCap(n)` preallocates at construction; `Grow(n)`
  reserves room for `n` more elements on an existing queue so subsequent pushes
  do not reallocate.
- **Reclaim memory** — `Shrink` and `Clip` shrink the capacity to the current
  length (see below); `Clear` releases the backing array entirely.
- **Reuse memory** — `Reset` empties the queue but keeps the capacity for refilling.
- **Stable capacity** — `Pop` and `PopN` free slots for reuse, but they do not
  reduce the value reported by `Cap`.

## `Shrink` vs `Clip`

Both reduce the capacity to the current length, but they make opposite
trade-offs between work done now and memory reclaimed now:

| Operation | Copies?                         | Cost          | Frees unused memory                  | Use when                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Shrink`  | yes (new array)                 | O(n)          | immediately                          | The queue grew large, has shrunk, and you want the memory back now. |
| `Clip`    | only if wrapped elements require compaction | O(n) worst case | not guaranteed immediately           | You want reported capacity trimmed to `Len` and can accept lazy reclaim. |

```go
q := queue.NewWithCap[int](1024)
q.PushN(1, 2, 3)

q.Clip()
fmt.Println(q.Len(), q.Cap()) // 3 3  — compact reported capacity

q.Grow(2000)
q.Shrink()
fmt.Println(q.Len(), q.Cap()) // 3 3  — copied into a right-sized array, old one freed
```

Both are no-ops when `Cap` already equals `Len`.

## `Clear` vs `Reset`

Both empty the queue and zero the removed elements (so the backing array no
longer retains references to them), but they differ in what happens to the
allocated memory:

| Operation | Empties queue | Backing array              | `Cap` afterwards | Use when                                                  |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Clear`   | yes           | released (eligible for GC) | `0`              | You are done with the queue, or want to free its memory.  |
| `Reset`   | yes           | retained for reuse         | unchanged        | You will refill the queue and want to avoid reallocating. |

```go
q := queue.NewWithCap[int](8)
q.Push(1)
q.Push(2)

q.Reset()
fmt.Println(q.Len(), q.Cap()) // 0 8  — capacity kept for reuse

q.Clear()
fmt.Println(q.Len(), q.Cap()) // 0 0  — backing array released
```

### Ring-buffer capacity

The queue stores elements in a ring buffer. When elements are popped, their
slots become available for later pushes; the buffer does not have to slide or
shrink. This keeps `Cap` stable across `Pop`/`PopN` and lets `Reset` preserve the
full allocation even after many removals.

## Nil receiver

The nil zero value of `*Queue[T]` behaves as a valid **empty** queue for every
read-only method, so you can safely query a `nil` queue without first calling
`New`:

```go
var q *queue.Queue[int] // nil

q.Len()        // 0
q.IsEmpty()    // true
q.Cap()        // 0
v, ok := q.Peek() // 0, false
v, ok = q.Pop()   // 0, false (nothing to remove)
q.PopN(3)      // nil
q.Slice()      // nil
for range q.All() { /* never runs */ }
```

`Clone` on a nil receiver returns a **new, usable empty queue** (never `nil`),
so the result can be pushed to immediately.

Methods that store or resize data — `Push`, `PushN`, `Grow`, `Clear`, `Reset`,
`Shrink` and `Clip` — need a non-nil receiver, so they **panic** on a `nil`
queue. Create the queue with `New` or `NewWithCap` before calling them.

## Concurrency

A `Queue` is **not safe for concurrent use**: it performs no internal locking.
If a queue is shared across goroutines, the caller must provide its own
synchronization (for example, a `sync.Mutex`).

## Benchmarks

Measured with Go 1.26.5 on windows/amd64, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor, 2026-10-01. Each value is the median of 5 runs of `go test -run NONE -bench . -benchmem -benchtime 200ms -count 5`. Absolute numbers depend on hardware, Go version, and system load, so compare rows with each other rather than with other machines.

| Benchmark | What it measures | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----: | ---: | --------: |
| `Push` | enqueue into a growing queue | 8.4 | 41 | 0 |
| `PushN` | one `PushN` of 1024 values | 2 206 | 0 | 0 |
| `Pop` | one `Pop` | 2.1 | 0 | 0 |
| `PopN` | one `PopN` of 128 values | 675 | 1 024 | 1 |
| `Peek` | one `Peek` | 1.3 | 0 | 0 |
| `PushPopChurn` | push and pop with 16 live elements | 5.7 | 0 | 0 |
| `All` | iterate 1024 elements | 2 228 | 0 | 0 |
| `Slice` | copy 1024 elements | 1 482 | 8 192 | 1 |

- `B/op` for `Push` is the amortized cost of growing the ring buffer; `allocs/op` rounds down to 0 because growth happens once per many pushes. Pre-size with `NewWithCap` or `Grow` to avoid it.

Run them with:
